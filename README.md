### Estimation of lasso in Neyman-Rubin model

Advisor: Professor Hanzhong Liu from Tsinghua University 

An application of lasso used in Neyman-Rubin model is proposed by Adam-Hanzhong-et al(2016) and a later result proposed by Wager-et al(2016) improves it, which is not checked carefully. My work is to check the later result and try to improve an inequality used in the previous to obtain a better condition of the asymptotic efficiency of the lasso estimator.
