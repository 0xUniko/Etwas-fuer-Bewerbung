Here are some projects, seminars, courses I have engaged in and learned a lot.

### Drug Sensitivity Ranking

Advisor: Professor Yuan Yao from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 

A kaggle contest held by Prof Yao for the drug sensitivity ranking, based on pairwise comparison data on cancer cell lines whose genetic (binary) features are also provided.More details can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/drugsensitivity-3)

I gained a lot experience in processing data with python, including using numpy, pandas and scikit-learn which are the essential tools for data science. 

I succeeded in winning first place in this contest.

### Estimation of lasso in Neyman-Rubin model

Advisor: Professor Hanzhong Liu from Tsinghua University 

An application of lasso used in Neyman-Rubin model is proposed by Adam-Hanzhong-et al(2016) and a later result proposed by Wager-et al(2016) improves it, which is not checked carefully. My work is to check the later result and try to improve an inequality used in the previous to obtain a better condition of the asymptotic efficiency of the lasso estimator.

### A deep learning approach to objection detection 

Advisor: Professor Ke Deng and Dr. Wanchuang Zhu from Tsinghua University 

A temple of Song dynasty is discovered and researchers want to extract the specific architecture from the fresco of this temple. The methods of machine learning is applied by our group and my work is to learn tensorflow and basic knowledge about deep learning and discuss them in the workshop. 

In this project I learn a lot about python. I have the basic idea about neural network. And I train my ability in writing neural network with tensorflow. 

### A seminar for non-parametric statistics and functional data analysis

Advisor: Professor Lijian Yang from Tsinghua University

I learn a lot!

### The course Machine Learning

Teacher: Liwei Wang from Peking University

I learned some foudation of statistic machine learning theory and Reinenfored Learning.

### The course Stochastic Analysis

Teacher: Zongxia Liang from Tsinghua University

After finishing this course, I will be invincible where probability is used!
